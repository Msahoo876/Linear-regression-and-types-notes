Linear regression is an algorithm that provides a linear relationship between an independent variable
and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of future events. It is a statistical method used
in data science and machine learning for predictive analysis.
The independent variable is also the predictor or explanatory variable that remains unchanged due
to the change in other variables. However, the dependent variable changes with fluctuations in the
independent variable. The regression model predicts the value of the dependent variable, which is
the response or outcome variable being analyzed or studied.
Thus, linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that simulates a mathematical relationship
between variables and makes predictions for continuous or numeric variables such as sales, salary,
age, product price, etc.
This analysis method is advantageous when at least two variables are available in the data, as
observed in stock market forecasting, portfolio management, scientific analysis, etc.
The general form of a linear regression equation with one independent variable is: ### y = mx
+ b
where:
• y is the dependent variable.
• x is the independent variable.
• m is the slope of the line.
• b is the y-intercept.
The goal of linear regression is to find the values of m and b that minimize the difference between
the predicted values (mx+b) and the actual values of the dependent variable(y).
